I'm Chris Lindsay, the founder of this community and I've made it my one mission:  

> Helping people living in survival mode, find relief. Equipping them for today's fast paced stressful lives. So they can live empowered inspired lives.


I live in Edinburgh, Scotland with my wife Leanne. I've been a competetive athlete from aged 14, when I discovered rowing.  Rowing gave me an outlet for the boundless energy, channelling it into structured training, working as part of a team towards a common goal and increased my self worth and esteem. I found if I trained hard and listened to what my coach said, I improved. I got faster, stronger. I was small and skinny then so I also learnt I needed to train not just harder, but smarter too.

My work ethic may have been honed through rowing, but it was formed back when I discovered, aged 8, I had dyslexia. This meant reading, writing and spelling was harder for me. I was blessed to get a wonderful guide to show me strategies to manage the way my brain was wired. Let say right now, having dyslexia is not a limitation, in many ways I see it as an advantage. Struggle is good. It leads to strength, just like lifting weights strengthens a weaker muscle, in time that same muscle becomes stronger, more resilient through adaptation to training. What I failed to notice at the time learning strategies to handle dyslexia equipped me for more than reading and spellings. When I discovered rowing, being small skinny didn't put me off. I had a coach again and they told me to do stuff which would make me stronger, faster. But I had the advantage to my dyslexic brain, now equipped to put strategies in place, short cuts to make things easier for me, like how I remember to spell 'together' (to-get-her). See, what one may see an a limitation, I learned to see as an advantage.

This is what I bring to you with 'Breathe Live Inspire'. It is my absolute desire to equip you with the tools to get out of survival mode and find relief from out ever more overwhelming and stress inducing lives. I can't stop the stressors you will continue to face, but I can equip you to handle them. 

[Stress has both a physical (objective) and a psychological (subjective) component](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5137920/ "The effects of chronic stress on health"). The subjective part is important. Mariotti, writes, "not all stimuli that elicit strong neuroendocrine responses are real stressors, but only those that exceed the individual's ability to change and adapt." 

what stresses out one person, another may see as managable or even exciting. Your ability to reframe a situation empowers you to face whatever life can throw at you. 

With the right tools and strategies you'll feel equipped and empowered to face whatever life throws at you. 

When you break out of survival mode, you find relief and your body is able to restore itself to equilibrium (homoeostasis). This may not happen overnight, but equipped with the right tools to empower you to feel inspired not overwhelmed.
