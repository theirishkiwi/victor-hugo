I'm Chris Lindsay, the founder of this community and I've made it my one mission:  

> Helping people living in survival mode, find relief. Equipping them for today's fast-paced lifestyle. So they can thrive.


I live in Edinburgh, Scotland with my wife, Leanne. I've been a competitive athlete from aged 14 when I discovered rowing.  Rowing gave me an outlet for my boundless energy, channelling it into structured training. Working as part of a team towards a common goal, increased my self-worth and esteem. I found if I trained hard and listened to my coach, I improved. I got faster and stronger. I was small and skinny then, so I also learnt I needed to train not just harder, but even smarter.


My work ethic may have been honed through rowing, but it was formed when I discovered, aged 8, I had dyslexia. This meant reading, writing and spelling words were more difficult for me. I was blessed with an excellent teacher who showed me strategies to manage the way my brain was wired. Let me say right now, having dyslexia is not a limitation, in many ways I see it as an advantage. Struggling is good. It leads to strength, just like lifting weights strengthens a weaker muscle, in time that same muscle becomes stronger and more resilient through adaptation to training. What I failed to notice at the time were the learning strategies I used to manage my dyslexia equipped me for more than reading, writing and spelling. When I discovered rowing, being small skinny didn't put me off. I had a coach (teacher) again, who provided structure and a program to make me stronger and faster. But I had an advantage, with my dyslexic brain. I was already equipped with strategies for learning. I had become skilled in finding short-cuts when I neede to remember a word for example. This meant I when I did anything, I would automatically think, how can I make this easier, how can I do this more efficiently. When it came to rowing the ability to move the boat more efficiently than you're competition is a massive advantage! See, what one may see a limitation, I learned to mind as an advantage.


It is this mindset that I bring with me here. It is my absolute desire to equip you with the tools to get out of survival mode and find relief from overwhelming and stressful. I can't stop the stressors you will continue to face, but equipped with the right tools and strategies you can handle them. 


[Stress has both a physical (objective) and a psychological (subjective) component](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5137920/ "The effects of chronic stress on health"). The subjective part is important. Mariotti, writes, "_not all stimuli that elicit strong neuroendocrine responses are real stressors, but only those that exceed the individual's ability to change and adapt." 



What stresses out one person, another may see as manageable or even exciting. Your ability to reframe a situation empowers you to face whatever life can throw at you. 


When you break out of survival mode, you find relief. Your body can finally restore itself to equilibrium (homoeostasis). Equipped with the right tools, you can thrive.
