I don't recall exactly how old I was at the time, maybe 8 years old. I was at the swimming pool with my family. This pool had a separate diving pool with three diving boards. A one, three and five metres. I remember vividly the first time I jumped off the highest board, even climbing the steps to reach the high board was scary. I stepped off the last step onto the diving platform, it felt wide and a long way to the edge! I slowly shuffled to towards the edge of the board and the water below started to come into view, opening up below as I move closer to the edge. My hands were clammy and a knot grew in my stomach. I reached the edge and looked down, then shuffled back a little, it was looked like a long way to the water below. Doubt filled my head with reasons not to jump. I also knew the longer I waited the greater the chance these doubts would talk me out of jumping. I weighed this with the thought of climbing back down the ladder.

I shuffled forward again, looked down, and thought if I'm going to jump I need to just do it. I remember thinking once I'm in the air there's no going back. I counted down and stepped off the board. All at once I felt rushing air, my tummy jumping into my mouth, I grabbed my nose and pointed my toes. I'd done it and survived! I felt amazing! Fear turned to excitement and satisfaction in an instant. I was out of the pool and back up the ladder to jump again, I was hooked.

In a matter of moments, I had gone from feeling scared to confident. But until I chose to step off the edge of the diving board, the only thing stopping me was my own fear.

As children, our lives were full of firsts. Full of opportunities to face our fears. Learning to ride a bike, learning to swim, your first day at school, first time catching the bus by yourself, jumping off a diving board.
Each time you met the challenge you showed courage, proved you were capable and grew more confident.

As we move into adulthood, most of us become comfortable as we have fewer firsts, take fewer risks, stop finding opportunities to step out of our comfort zone.

> "We try to design a future where courage is not required anymore."

What happens?

Without courage, we stop growing. We stopping pushing at the edge of our comfort zones. Our comfort zones might even begin to close in around us as we look for the path of least resistance.

Courage is necessary.

This is why I created My Monday Challenge. As a way to help you start pushing out your comfort zones again. Just as you did as a kid. When you acted without fear, and even when you were scared and you did it anyway!

Each step might have been a small one but every time you felt scared and acted anyway you grew. You felt more able and sure of yourself.

Why is showing courage so scary?

Because just like me standing on the edge of the highest diving board aged 8, looking down. I didn't know I'd be ok until I stepped off the edge. Until the moment took that step I had no proof I'd be able to do it. Yes, I watched other kids climb up and jump off the top and they were fine. The even looked like they enjoyed it. But, I didn't have the confidence until I did it.

This is a funny thing about confidence. We think we need to feel confident first before we act. But, the reality is that's not how confidence works.

You feel scared and do it anyway. As soon as you act you prove to yourself you are capable and feel more confident as a result.

Now feeling more confident you climb up the steps and think I'm going to jump higher this time. And the cycle continues.

A challenge works in much the same way. No one challenged me to jump off the top diving board but they could have done. If I had accepted the challenge and completed it, I'd have got the same result. I'd have done something that scared me and felt more confident as a result.

My Monday Challenge grew out of a challenge my mentor Benjamin Hardy gave me back in October 2018. Ben, challenged me to get some quick wins to start building momentum. To break past any emotional resistance to change.

Do something unexpected.

On Monday 15th October 2018, I wrote in my journal.
"Doing something unexpected! This morning I woke at 6am and run up Arthur's Seat before work. 9.5 miles and 1,306 feet vertical gain. It was definitely different, unexpected. Radical, maybe?
I definitely stretched my mind beyond my norm. It left me thinking \[about\] what can I do next to build momentum?"

Arthur's Seat is an extinct volcano in overlooking Holyrood Park in Edinburgh, Scotland.

I continued running up to Arthur's Seat every Monday morning before work for the remainder of 2018.

### #MyMondayChallenge.

My weekly ritual grew into My Monday Challenge. I discovered challenge was one of my core values. Our core or personal values are things we believe are important in our work and life. When I looked back at my life so far, the events that have shaped me into the person I am today were obstacles that could have defined me, but I chose to use them to grow and challenge me to become stronger, better and more determined. Being diagnosed with Dyslexia aged 8 and my height and skinniness when I discovered rowing at the age of 14. The two events, dyslexia followed by rowing, unrelated maybe but recently I saw how overcoming dyslexia prepared me for rowing, a sport where my height and strength were not to my advantage.
