The term “emotional hijack” was coined by Daniel Goleman, in his book, [Emotional Intelligence](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Emotional-Intelligence-Matter-More-Than/dp/0747528306). 
He defines chronic stress as uncrontrolable worry, when the emotional brain triggers an emotional response before the thinking brain has a chance to process it.


## Out of Control Emotions 

Sustained emotional hijackings generate a steady hum of anxiety, which over time can ultimately lead to chronic anxiety.


Chronic anxiety, can trigger the stress response which sets of a chain of reactions in the brain and body. You feel a surge of adrenaline, your heart quickens, your palms feel sweaty, your muscles tense up, these physiological reactions are known as the "fight or fight" response. This response is healthy if the situation is life threatening, but today we are triggered by so many events, from being stuck in heavy traffic, dealines at work, credit card bills, the list goes no. None of which are endangering our lives, well not directly. 

This Emotional stress can lead to sickness. When fight or flight is triggered daily releasing a stream of checmicals into the brain and body including; cortisol which boosts your energy for fight of flight, by increasing your blood pressure and glucose levels in the blood. Cortisol can also shut down functions that get in the way when danger strikes, including your digestive and immune system.

After the danger has passed cortisol levels should return to normal along with your blood pressure and heart rate. 

But, if you are under constant stress, with elevated levels, you get sick. 

What are the effects of chronic stress? [Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-athletes-way/201301/cortisol-why-the-stress-hormone-is-public-enemy-no-1) summed it up: “Chronic stress and elevated cortisol levels also increase risk for depression, mental illness, weight gain, blood pressure and heart disease and interfere with learning and memory. 


There is a growing body of research into the impact of chronic stress and with our lives becoming faster and tech keeping us connected 24/7, it can feel like there is no off switch, as our lives carear out of control. 


## Balance Restored

Emotions are vital for a healthy life. Without them life would be bland and we would be unable to make decisions about the simpliest of tasks as we would have no way to measure how we felt about one choice over another. it is these feelings that provide colour to our emotions. [Antonio R. Damasio](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/feeling-our-emotions/), during 40 years of research has strived to show that feelings are what arise as the brain interprets emotions, which are purely physical signals of the body reacting to external stimuli.

The problems occurs when we fail to handle our emotions properly they build up and are expressed as anxiety, depression, anger, guilt which if not processed they will eventually present with physical symptoms and make us sick.

Thankfully, with the right tools and routines you can train your body and mind to handle your emotions in a healthy way.

Managing our emotions, means we are less vunerable to the upheavals of the emotional brain. we may not be able to control when an emotion may arise, but we can have some say in how long an emotion may last, by getting your mind off your worries and focusing you mind instead on relaxation.

### Take a deep breath

Taking a few deep slow breaths, has been shown to stimulate the vagus nerve triggering a relaxation response in your body, slowing your heart rate,  lowering your blood-pressure and decreasing cortisol in your body. The next time you feel stress or anxiety buildy, you can take 5 or 6 deep slow breaths over a minute and you'll feel your body relax and tension begin to release. I use this all the time, as you can do it anywhere. Sometimes we're in the car and my wife asks - "are you ok?" and I reply - "Yes. I'm just breathing." Try it for yourself.
