# Emotional Hijack

The term “emotional hijack” was coined by Daniel Goleman, in his book, Emotional Intelligence. 
He defines chronic stress as uncrontrolable worry, when the emotional brain triggers an emotional response before the thinking brain has a chance to process it.


## Out of Control Emotions 

- what this section is about

Sustained emotional hijackings generate a steady hum of anxiety, which over time can ultimately lead to chronic anxiety.

- why it matters

Chronic anxiety, can trigger the stress response which sets of a chain of reactions in the brain and body. You feel a surge of adrenaline, your heart quickens, your palms feel sweaty, your muscles tense up, these physiological reactions are known as the "fight or fight" response. This response is healthy if the situation is life threatening, but today we are triggered by so many events, from being stuck in heavy traffic, dealines at work, credit card bills, the list goes no. None of which are endangering our lives, well not directly. 

This Emotional stress can lead to sickness. When fight or flight is triggered daily releasing a stream of checmicals into the brain and body including; cortisol which boosts your energy for fight of flight, by increasing your blood pressure and glucose levels in the blood. Cortisol can also shut down functions that get in the way when danger strikes, including your digestive and immune system.

After the danger has passed cortisol levels should return to normal along with your blood pressure and heart rate. 

But, if you are under constant stress, with elevated levels, you get sick.

## Feeling Healthy - Balance Restored

Emotions are vital for a healthy life. Without them life would be bland and we would be unable to make decisions about the simpliest of tasks as we would have no way to measure how we felt about one choice over another. it is these feelings that provide colour to our emotions. [Antonio R. Damasio](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/feeling-our-emotions/), during 40 years of research has strived to show that feelings are what arise as the brain interprets emotions, which are purely physical signals of the body reacting to external stimuli.

The problems occurs when we fail to handle our emotions properly they build up and are expressed as anxiety, depression, anger, guilt which if not processed they will eventually present with physical symptoms and make us sick.

Thankfully, with the right tools and routines you can train your body and mind to handle your emotions in a healthy way.
