The term “emotional hijack” was coined by Daniel Goleman, in his book, [Emotional Intelligence](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Emotional-Intelligence-Matter-More-Than/dp/0747528306). 
He defines chronic stress as uncontrollable worry when the emotional brain triggers an emotional response before the thinking mind has a chance to process it.


## Out of Control Emotions 

Sustained emotional hijackings generate a steady hum of anxiety, which over time can ultimately lead to chronic stress.


Chronic anxiety can trigger the stress response which sets off a chain of reactions in the brain and body. You feel a surge of adrenaline; your heart quickens, your palms feel sweaty, your muscles tense up, these physiological reactions are expressed as the "fight or flight" response. This response is healthy if the situation is life-threatening, but today we are triggered by so many events, from being stuck in heavy traffic, deadlines at work, credit card bills, none of which are endangering our lives, well not directly. 

This Emotional stress can lead to sickness when fight or flight is triggered daily releasing a stream of chemicals into the brain and body including; cortisol which boosts your energy for the fight or flight, by increasing your blood pressure and glucose levels in the blood. Cortisol can also shut down functions that get in the way when danger strikes, including your digestive and immune system.

After the danger has passed cortisol levels should return to normal along with your blood pressure and heart rate. 

However, if you are under constant stress, with elevated levels, you get sick. 

What are the effects of chronic stress? [Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-athletes-way/201301/cortisol-why-the-stress-hormone-is-public-enemy-no-1) summed it up: “Chronic stress and elevated cortisol levels also increase the risk for depression, mental illness, weight gain, blood pressure and heart disease and interfere with learning and memory. 


There is a growing body of research into the impact of chronic stress and with our lives becoming faster and tech keeping us connected 24/7, it can feel like there is no off switch, as our lives career out of control. 


## Balance Restored

Emotions are vital for a healthy life. Without them, life would be bland, and we would be unable to make decisions about the simplest of tasks as we would have no way to measure how we felt about one choice over another. it is these feelings that provide colour to our emotions. [Antonio R. Damasio](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/feeling-our-emotions/), during 40 years of research has strived to show that feelings are what arise as the brain interprets emotions, which are purely physical signals of the body reacting to external stimuli.

The problems occur when we fail to handle our emotions properly they build up and are expressed as anxiety, depression, anger, guilt which if not processed they will eventually present with physical symptoms and make us sick.

Thankfully, with the right tools and routines, you can train your body and mind to handle your emotions healthily.

Managing our emotions, means we are less vulnerable to the upheavals of the emotional brain. We may not be able to control when an emotion may arise, but we can have some say in how long a feeling may last, by getting your mind off your worries and focusing your mind instead on relaxation.

### Take a deep breath

Taking a few deep slow breaths has been shown to stimulate the vagus nerve triggering a relaxation response in your body, slowing your heart rate,  lowering your blood pressure and decreasing cortisol in your body. The next time you feel stress or anxiety building, you can take 5 or 6 deep slow breaths over a minute, and you'll notice your body relax, and tension begins to release. I use this all the time, as you can do it anywhere. Sometimes we're in the car, and my wife asks - "are you ok?" and I reply - "Yes. I'm just breathing." Try it for yourself.

PMR is a simple technique developed by Edmund Jacobson MD, PhD in the 1930s. His premise was that 'mental calmness is a natural result of physical relaxation.'
