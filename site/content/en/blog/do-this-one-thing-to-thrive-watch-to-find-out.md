Life can be stressful. In fact, let's be honest - life is full of stress. We have hectic lives with constant demands on our time and money pressures. The list goes on.

Stress triggers the release of chemicals into the body which set off a chain reaction. Necessary if you are facing a wild animal. No so much if you’re worried about bills you need to pay or ‘that’ meeting with your boss.

Facing a wild animal at least requires immediate action. There’s no time to worry or get anxious. This is an appropriate stress response to a tangible threat. You need to fight or run! whichever you choose you’re using the energy your body has just made available to you and reducing your body's stress hormones, such as adrenaline and cortisol helping you return to a relaxed state faster.

The good news is almost any kind of exercise helps reduce stress or anxiety. Wild animals need not be involved. A 20-minute walk is enough to clear your mind and reduce stress. it’ll stimulate the production of endorphins, chemicals in the brain that are the body’s natural painkillers and mood elevators. Walking improves your cognitive function, memory, and give you more energy. And if you do it regularly it’ll quickly become a habit and just something you do.  

The next time you arrive home stressed and feeling overwhelmed lace up your trainers and head out for a walk around the block. You’ll feel better when you get home. You might also find you sleep better and as I mentioned in my last video if you can walk through a park and take a moment to enjoy your natural surrounds you’ll be prescribing yourself nature as well, which can only be a good thing.

PMR is a simple technique developed by Edmund Jacobson MD, PhD in the 1930s. His premise was that 'mental calmness is a natural result of physical relaxation.'
