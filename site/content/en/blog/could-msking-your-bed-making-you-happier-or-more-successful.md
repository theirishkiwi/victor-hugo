Could making your bed make you more successful or happier? 

I've been making my bed when I get up in the morning for, I don't know, years probably. I remember watching a video quite recently when a Navy SEAL General, (Correction; he is a 4-star Admiral) talked about the benefits of making your bed. Making your bed in the morning set you up for success for the day, and I thought I'd look into what's the research behind making your bed. There was a survey, over 68,000 people. Of those 68,000 people, 27% made their bed, so actually, people who make their bed seems to be in the minority. 59% didn't make their beds, and the other 12% paid someone else like a housekeeper to make their beds.

Interestingly enough of that 27%, 71% of those consider themselves to be happier. Of the 59% who didn't make their beds, when asked, they admitted to being less happy. The survey also showed that people who made their beds were likely to be happier in their job exercise more, feel more rested, and generally happier, and more successful compared to those who didn't make their bed and they were considered to be less happy in their jobs, and generally less successful.

That's not to say people who don't make their beds are unsuccessful or unhappy, but it seems that there's quite a high correlation based on this survey of 68,000 people where people who make your bed, who spend those 30 seconds in the morning making their bed actually are more productive and less stressed. Though it definitely seems that if indict between making your bed and not, it's probably worth spending those 30, 40 seconds in the morning, making your bed when you get up, and then you've completed one task of the day successfully and you have set yourself up for success of the day.

Even if you do have a bad day, you're going to come home to your made bed. As I said before, Navy SEALs do this and they consider it particularly important, so if you don't actually make your bed in SEAL training, you're going to get beasted. They see it as a vital and high priority thing to be done. I just wanted to share those thoughts to you. Making your bed, if you're currently making your bed, that's great, but it seems like you're probably are in the minority.

If you're not making your bed and you're not necessarily 100% convinced by the survey and say, "How can making your bed make you more successful and happier?", the way I see it is if you're in doubt for those 30 seconds it takes to make your bed, it's probably worth doing it. I've been making my bed for years. Does it make me happier? I'm not sure.

I can't say either way because I’ve been making my bed so long that I probably can't remember how it was before I made my bed. It does seem that making your bed , based on this survey of 68,000 people can make you happier and more successful. That's really all I wanted to share with you this week.

My suggestion is, spend those 30 seconds in the morning making your bed, set yourself up for success. One task successfully completed has the potential to lead to more tasks completed and make you feel more motivated through the day. That's really all I really wanted to share with you this week and I will talk to you again next week.

### Ready to Thrive?

Jim Rohn puts it best. “Success is nothing more than a few simple disciplines practiced daily.” Are you ready to take your life to the next level? To start moving in a new direction? I would love nothing more that to see you go from stuck to succeeding; from surviving to thriving.

I have created a seven (7) day challenge, for you. It introduces one new discipline I practice everyday.

    > “Success is not to be pursued; it is to be attracted by the person you become.” \~ Jim Rohn

Seven days will not change your destination, but if you commit to getting up everyday determined to get from the day and not just through it, you can change the direction of your life in seven short days.
