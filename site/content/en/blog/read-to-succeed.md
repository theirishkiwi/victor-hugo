Hi. Thanks for joining me today on my live video. Today, I will continue talking about Jim Rohn. I mentioned last week I 've started listening to his audible, The Ultimate Jim Rohn Library, which is about 10 plus hours of audio which he's recorded in live training's. Unfortunately, Jim Rohn has passed away in 2009, but his audios are still there. They are powerful in the areas of growth, self-improvement, wealth, health, and success.

This week I want to talk specifically about reading. Jim Rohn has tons of quotes. If you search for quotes on Jim Rohn you will find there's so many out there, but specifically on reading, that's what I find quite challenging, personally. He says that "successful people have libraries and the rest of us have big screen TVs". "Successful people have libraries, the rest have big screen TVs". I can't claim that I don't watch a lot of television myself.

> "successful people have libraries and the rest have big screen TVs" - Jim Rohn

I like watching Netflix and various series on Amazon Prime, but I think what Jim's getting at is the fact that if you spend more time watching TV and less time reading, you're going to be less successful. He's basically saying that successful people read books, successful people have libraries.


We think about other successful people like Warren Buffet, for example. He is another person who loves to read and probably has a massive library, and probably cares more about his library than he does about his bank account. These people succeed because they're learning constantly through learning about other people and how they have succeeded and overcome challenges. Books on growth, wealth, health, success, biographies, is a big one, which I like to read too, by learning how someone else has succeeded, by overcoming challenges. Any challenge that you might be dealing with or struggling with, there'll be someone else out there who has the same challenge, who's written a book, most likely about how they have overcome it. I think that's a great place to start.

I do have a physical library. I've got some books here and more books over here. I've got boxes of books. Leanne, my wife, is obsessed with the fact that I've got so many books and not enough space to put them. I constantly have to keep them organized and tidied away, so you can't actually have them all at any one time. These days, my biggest library is actually on Audible. Since 2013 I've built up a library of about 96 books, and the number of books I'm reading on Audible is growing all the time. I think most days I'm reading for about at least an hour, or listening should I say.


My runs, I've mentioned this before, that I'll listen to audio books rather than music when I'm out running. I might for like an hour, an hour and a half run, then that's an hour and a half of audio that I got to listen to and be learning something whilst I'm out there training. Getting fitter, getting healthier and, also, improve my mind.

A story, back when I about eight years old, I got diagnosed with dyslexia. That's a challenge with spelling, punctuation, reading, reading out loud, and something else I struggled with. I think before the age of eight I didn't really read much, but I got a teacher who got me into reading, as well as learning other techniques of spelling, punctuation and just basically how to overcome dyslexia. A year or so later, I had a friend who stayed over at my house, and they left behind one of their books. I think it was a book on The Hardy Boys, an investigation series, or The Three Investigators, I can't remember which. Either way, I started reading that book and from that point forward I was obsessed with Hardy Boys and Three Investigators, as well as Enid Blyton and any other sort of detective books.

That's what I started reading when I was younger, to the point where I would start reading some books and then not put the book down until I was finished. I 'd spend three or four hours reading until I finished that book. I'm convinced that, that amongst other things, reading is what helped me overcome my dyslexia and I now see it as an advantage. It's helped me with my punctuation, grammar, imagination, comprehension, spurred me on to improve myself and I no longer see it as a limitation.

I wanted to share that with you today. Any struggles and challenges that you might be having, there's someone else out there who's written a book, who's overcome the same challenges. Why struggle yourself when you can learn from someone else who's had similar challenges? That's why I love reading so much because you're able to learn from other people. The key thing is, as much as you read these books, it's a matter of putting into practice, these things you learn, taking action. That, personally, is a thing I struggle with as well.
That's what I want to leave you with today and build up your library, whether it be physical or, like myself, with my audible library. See how you get on. Any questions or comments on that, as always, I would love to hear them. I look forward to speaking with you again next week.


### Ready to Thrive?

Jim Rohn puts it best. “Success is nothing more than a few simple disciplines practiced daily.” Are you ready to take your life to the next level? To start moving in a new direction? I would love nothing more that to see you go from stuck to succeeding; from surviving to thriving.

> “Success is nothing more than a few simple disciplines practiced daily.” ~ Jim Rohn

I have created a seven (7) day challenge, for you. It introduces one new discipline I practice everyday.

> “Success is not to be pursued; it is to be attracted by the person you become.” ~ Jim Rohn

Seven days will not change your destination, but if you commit to getting up everyday determined to get from the day and not just through it, you can change the direction of your life in seven short days.

> “You cannot change your destination overnight, but you can change your direction overnight.” ~ Jim Rohn
